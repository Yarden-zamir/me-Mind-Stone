# What Are You Doing Yarden?
I base a lot of my thinking on a loose model of [[Action Potential model|Action Potential]], I believe that to make something happen I can either expand willpower (fuel) in order to push myself towards that goal. Or I can expand will power to instead reduce the friction of achieving said goal.

I always wanted to write more than just to myself, this is my attempt to do so, by making my writing [[Public by default]] and thus making the friction point on the **hiding** action instead of on the **sharing** one

# Half Baked
The nature of [[Public by default]] means that most of the "content" here is half baked ideas and tangents, that's alright

# Open Source tho??
I think it would be cool to think, if already in a public way, also in an open one. Anyone can "fork my mind" or change it with a pull request, I really like that idea. Anyone can raise issues with my thinking (or with me in general I guess, that would funny)

# Ok, but How?
[MindStone](https://mindstone.tuancao.me/) is a free open-source alternative solution to [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) that generates a next js static site that I can then ci directly from github to netify or gh pages
